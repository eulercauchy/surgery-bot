# surgery-bot
A method for training, programming, and testing a surgery robot for use on human anatomy.

The purpose of this repository is to make a training simulator to design a robot to perform surgery on human anatomy.  We will start with a good enough approach, just get something working.  Then refine, test, refine.

The current approach is as follows:
Create virtual environment for testing and creation of training data for a ML algorithm to identify organs positions and poses.

It is expected to use Unreal Engine 5 as the visualization engine.

Behavior trees and ROS2 for the control of the Robot.
